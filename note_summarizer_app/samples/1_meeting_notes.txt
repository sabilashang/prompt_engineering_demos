Weekly Team Meeting - November 8, 2024

Attendees: Sarah Johnson (Product Manager), Mike Chen (Lead Developer), Emily Rodriguez (UX Designer), Tom Williams (QA Lead)

Agenda Items:

1. Product Launch Update
Sarah reported that the new mobile app feature is 85% complete. The backend API integration is finished, but we're still working on the frontend animations. The marketing team wants to push the launch date from November 20th to December 1st to allow more time for beta testing. Everyone agreed this is a wise decision given the complexity of the new features.

2. User Feedback Analysis
Emily presented findings from last week's user testing sessions. Key insights: 78% of users found the new navigation intuitive, but 45% struggled with the checkout process. We need to simplify the payment flow and add more visual indicators. Mike suggested implementing a progress bar, which received unanimous support.

3. Bug Fixes Priority
Tom outlined 23 critical bugs that need attention before launch. The top priority is the login timeout issue affecting iOS users. Mike assigned three developers to work on this immediately. Medium priority items include the search functionality lag and notification delivery delays.

4. Q4 Budget Review
The development budget is currently at 92% utilization with 6 weeks remaining in the quarter. We need to be strategic about any new hires or tool purchases. Sarah will meet with finance next week to discuss potential budget reallocation.

Action Items:
- Mike: Fix iOS login timeout by November 12th
- Emily: Redesign checkout flow mockups by November 10th
- Tom: Complete regression testing by November 15th
- Sarah: Schedule follow-up meeting with marketing team
- All: Review and approve updated project timeline by EOD Friday

Next meeting: November 15, 2024 at 2:00 PM
